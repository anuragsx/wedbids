<p>Testimonials 
<br />(Please see our facebook page for photos from all of these weddings)</p>

<p>Rochelle and John 26.10.2013 @ Lyndoch Hill Barossa say...</p>

<p>"We recently used Adelaide DJ Services at our Wedding in Lyndoch SA. The service we received right from when I first organised the DJ months prior to our wedding day has been great. The information I received, including quite extensive song lists was very helpful and being that we live 4 hours from Adelaide and didn’t actually meet face to face this was very helpful. The itinerary they sent through for us to fill out was simple and easy to populate and was also helpful when coordinating with our wedding planner. We requested that our dance floor be outside on the decking at our venue and they were willing to accommodate us. DJ Phil was our DJ for the evening and we were sent his profile a week before the wedding to make sure we were happy with this choice. He also phoned and introduced himself and got to know a little about what we wanted and liked. On the day DJ Phil was fantastic!! He was on time and set up before guests arrived. He was also our MC for the evening and did an amazing job! Several people commented saying how great he was. The music from start to finish was perfect and he assisted us in ensuring we stuck to our itinerary. I would highly recommend Adelaide DJ Services and DJ Phil to anyone looking for this service. Thank you for helping to make our day so special!"</p>

<p>Jason & Dannii 12.10.2013 @ Glenelg Golf Club say...</p>

<p>"Apologies for the delay in replying, we have just gotten back from our honeymoon.  Our reception was perfect and Sophie was fantastic.  From the moment we met her we were really comfortable with her and she made the process very easy.  We would have no hesitation in recommending your business or Sophie to anyone.  Thanks again."</p>

<p>Laryssa and Peter 28.09.2013 @ The Hilton say...</p>

<p>"I am sorry it has taken me so long to write back.  You, your wife and Paul were incredible. I cannot thank you enough for the amazing, fabulous Monogram that you provided.  It was such a simple decoration and it just lit up the room.  DJ Paul did a fantastic job and the night was a huge hit.  Paul also did an amazing job catering for the kids by playing kids music and they were extremely happy, excited, and because they were happy and occupied I was extremely happy and my daughter still talks about the night. Paul was truly amazing and was really professional with the meeting earlier in the week and on the night with the song choices.  Peter and I were absolutely astounded with the night, and loved everything DJ Paul really made our night.  He was sensational. Thank you for everything."</p>

<p>Kathy & Tim 14.09.2013 @ Ayers House say...</p>

<p>"What can I say! All through our wedding planning Billy provided constant and professional service . We met once to discuss all the formalities and then we met Paul , the DJ for our wedding. Paul came dressed in an immaculate suit , and was so professional and classy the whole evening. He made sure everything was perfect . So polite , so well dressed and played all our music we had requested . It was an absolute pleasure working with this company , don't go anywhere else , THANK YOU guys."</p>

<p>Amy & Nick 31.08.2013 @ St Francis Winery say...</p>

<p>"Billy, you were awesome! I would recommend you to anyone in a heart beat. The lights and monogram looked great as well. Nick and I would like thank you so much and if we ever need a DJ again for anything, it would be you without a doubt  :-)"</p>

<p>Gemma & Michael 03.08.2013 @ The Adelaide Pavillion say...</p>

<p>"Thank you billy for your amazing work with the music and for being a great mc we have had many compliments on having you as our dj, our night would not have been the same without you. The choice in music made everyone dance. We will and have highly recommended you. 
<br />Thank you!"</p>

<p>Louise & Dave 11.05.2013 @ The Adelaide Pavillion say...</p>

<p>"Hi Billy, I have already been in touch with DJ Paul thanking him for his amazing service. It was a great night and he was very professional and did a great job. We were also very impressed by the initial meeting with yourself and how organised it was, we will definitely recommend you in the future. Many thanks."</p>

<p>Corrine 09.03.2013 @ Kooronga Golf Club says...</p>

<p>"Billy and DJ Phil were amazing to work with. Billy made it so easy to organise the reception music the way we wanted it and then on the night DJ Phil was AMAZING! The dance floor was full the whole night!"</p>

<p>Melissa & Evert 23.02.2013 @ Ayers House say...</p>

<p>"Billy was very professional and willing to help with every request and personalise both the ceremony and reception music. Huge selection of music and willing to source any other music required. Billy also provided lighting, special effects, an excellent MC service and was more than willing to accommodate special requests on the night. (We had additional speeches that hadn't been planned for which went off without a hitch). We had guests of all ages and everyone had a ball with lots of dancing! Definitely to be recommended!"</p>

<p>Jeff & Jenny 16.02.2013 @ St. Francis Winery say...</p>

<p>"Hi Billy, we had a great wedding and a good honeymoon, well apart from Jenny being very sick for the first couple of days… Anyway, Sophie did a good job as our DJ for the wedding and it all went off very smoothly. The whole day/night turned out exactly as we had hoped and was one big party. I think her choice of music was superb and the timing of song choice was also excellent. Her MC skills were good and she is a lovely person, very easy to talk with and carried out all our requests with no fuss and no problems. Over all she did a good job and we were very happy indeed. I found your services overall to be very professional and you and Sophie were fantastic to deal with. Thank you for everything… All the best with the future.</p>

<p>Deeon & Chris 09.02.2013 @ Bridgewater Mill say...</p>

<p>My husband and I came across Billy & Adelaide DJ Services on the web, we were amazed by his attention to detail and suggestions that really made our reception a 'pumping' good night. Would highly recommend him for any function! Thanks so much Billy.</p>

<p>Kelly & Ash 04.01.2013 @ the Red Ochre say...</p>

<p>"Hi Billy, Thank you we had a wonderful night. You did a fantastic job, we really enjoyed your music as did all the guests. You were very professional and very accommodating. Many people commented on the music and you personally. We will definitely recommend you to all our friends. Thank you for helping  making our wedding night so special.</p>

<p>Sonia & Tom 28.12.2012 @ Glen Ewin Estate say...</p>

<p>"DJ Billy from Adelaide DJ Services was one of the most friendly, professional and talented individuals we had contribute to our wedding in December 2012.  Working with Billy in the lead up to the day was a pleasure.  He was super organised, full of good ideas and his input to our planning was invaluable.  He really understood what we were after and did a fantastic job on the day.  He took an interest in other aspects of what was happening during the reception, liasing with venue staff and our MC etc. and we could see the passion he has for his job.  Some of our best memories from our wedding happened on the dance floor and we can't thank DJ Billy enough for all his hard work, organisation and for all the fun he brought to our experience. 
<br />We wish you all the best Billy!"</p>

<p>Heath & Kirsty 15.12.2012 @ Tapestry McLaren Vale say...</p>

<p>"A massive thank you for a fantastic job on Saturday.  MC'ing was outstanding, lighting fantastic, really admired your ability to read the crowd and improvise where you felt it was necessary throughout the night.  Not only that, you were a very active and popular participant in the whole event which added a great deal. We really appreciated your open communication and advice in the lead up, which we believe played a big part in the success of the night."</p>

<p>Matt & Liza 01.12.2012 @ Mount Lofty House say...</p>

<p>"My wife and I recently got married early December and thought Billy from Adelaide DJ Services provided us with a very professional service. His attention to detail was exceptional. His experience in music selection and as an Mc were outstanding and we definitely would recommend him to anyone. Cheers mate."</p>

<p>Justin & Shanae 20.10.2012 & Saltram Estate Barossa say...</p>

<p>"Billy!! Wow! What a great night you put on for us on Saturday night!!!! We had such a fun night and so many of our guests have commented on how great the atmosphere was! A credit to you!! We really hope you enjoyed the evening as well:) We both loved every single song that you played all through the night and we are honoured that you were a part of our special day! Thank you so very much!"</p>
